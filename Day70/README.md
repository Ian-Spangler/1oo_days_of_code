This lecture is about taking advantage of git and github which is very useful tool.
Although I've been using github for the netire journey, I wasn't using github's many functions.
I was wondering how to not upload certain files that contains important information (password). Now I know how to which is by using .gitignore.
Also, I wasn't taking advantage of github's cloning, branching, and merging to an open source project. Even though not as skilled to contribute to large open source projects, I am looking forward to contribute in small open sources projects that welcomes beginners.
Finally, I learned the concept forking and pull request. This is used when uncertified user wants to contribute to repository.
